Periodically updates [this file](https://damianperera.github.io/sl-covid-fund/data.json) with the history of the amount of donations in the _COVID â€“ 19 Healthcare and Social Security Fund_ bank account at a given point in time as reflected in the [Presidential Secretariat](https://www.presidentsoffice.gov.lk/index.php/covid-19-fund/) webpage. The script will only save the latest fund value if there is a difference with the last recorded value.
